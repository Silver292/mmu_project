The \acrfull{iot} is an umbrella term used to describe physical `smart' devices
equipped with telecommunication interfaces, connected to one another via the 
Internet \citep{centenaro_long-range_2016}.
Whereas the Internet traditionally connected computers, the embedding of 
electronics into physical objects has allowed the Internet to expand \citep{miorandi_internet_2012}.
These devices can contain sensors which will produce data and in some cases 
these devices can be controlled remotely. The combination of these devices in
a network, especially when the actions of one devices are informed by the 
data from another device, is the foundation of \gls{iot} \citep{minerva_towards_2015}.
\gls{iot} systems can impact in many areas such as home automation,
where devices can work together to automate heating and security aspects of 
the home \citep{lee_internet_2018}, and medicine where devices
can be used as monitors to provide real time information about 
patient health \citep{kumar_iot_2016}.
