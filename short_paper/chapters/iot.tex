The \acrfull{iot} is an umbrella term used to describe physical `smart' devices
equipped with telecommunication interfaces, connected to one another via the 
Internet \citep{centenaro_long-range_2016}.
Whereas the Internet traditionally connected computers, the embedding of 
electronics into physical objects has allowed the Internet to expand \citep{miorandi_internet_2012}.
These devices can contain sensors which will produce data and in some cases, 
these devices can be controlled remotely. The combination of these devices in
a network, especially when the actions of one device are informed by the 
data from another device, is the foundation of \gls{iot} \citep{minerva_towards_2015}.
\gls{iot} systems can impact in many areas such as home automation,
where devices can work together to automate heating and security aspects of 
the home \citep{lee_internet_2018}, and medicine where devices
can be used as monitors to provide real-time information about 
patient health \citep{kumar_iot_2016}.

Although \gls{iot} lacks a standardized architecture approved by an authorized
body \citep{minerva_towards_2015},
\figref{fig:generic_iot_architecture} illustrates various common
components present within any given \gls{iot} architecture.
The sensor/actuator is the component that will receive data from the real 
world or perform a physical action. 
This data is then transmitted to a device which is
responsible for the sensor/actuator.
The device may be responsible for multiple sensors,
as in \citet{jassas_smart_2015},
which connected multiple e-health sensors to a single \gls{rpi} device.
This device will then communicate with a gateway.
The gateway is responsible for ensuring that 
the data is sent to the correct destination. 
Within \gls{coap}, the gateway would be a router ensuring messages are sent 
to the correct endpoints. The cloud is the final destination for the sensor data; 
here, the data will be stored and can be processed for further analysis.
