The \gls{coap}--based \gls{iot} architecture is proposed using a \acrlong{rpi},
temperature and humidity sensors and ThingsBoard \gls{iot} platform to monitor 
and visualise sensors data.
The \gls{coap} protocol is used to send the temperature and humidity data 
formatted as \acrfull{json} to the ThingsBoard cloud endpoint at regular intervals.
ThingsBoard is deployed to monitor and visualise data by creating  \gls{iot} 
Dashboards and updating in real-time.

The \gls{rpi} has been connected to a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor using
the \glspl{rpi} \gls{gpio} pins. A Python script running on the \gls{rpi} uses
an external library provided by AdaFruit to poll the sensor at intervals and 
obtain the current temperature and humidity. Using the CoAPthon 
library, a \gls{coap} client is created and used to send a \gls{coap} POST 
message containing the sensor data to a ThingsBoard telemetry endpoint.
This data is then displayed to the user in a dashboard.
