This research investigates the use of \gls{coap} in transmitting sensor data
to the cloud. It aims to explore how \gls{coap} fits into the \gls{iot} ecosystem and
what advantages, if any, it offers over other \gls{iot} protocols. A framework is proposed 
using a \gls{rpi} and sensor acting as an \gls{iot} endpoint. This endpoint will poll 
the sensor and using \gls{coap} will send the latest data formatted as \gls{json} to 
a \gls{coap} cloud endpoint at regular intervals.
The cloud service will receive, format and display the data from the \gls{rpi} 
to the user.
