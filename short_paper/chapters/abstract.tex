This research investigates the use of \gls{coap} in transmitting sensor data
to the cloud. It aims to explore how \gls{coap} fits into the \gls{iot} ecosystem and
what advantages, if any, it offers over other \gls{iot} protocols. A framework is proposed 
using a \gls{rpi} and sensor acting as an \gls{iot} endpoint. This endpoint will allow for
\gls{coap} requests and will poll the sensor and return the latest data as \gls{json}.
The endpoint will be polled from a cloud service, this service will then display the data to 
the user.
