In comparison to the research examined, this paper proposes using \gls{coap} to 
implement \gls{m2m} communication. 
The research undertaken in the study will benefit future research into \gls{iot}
devices and networks, providing knowledge of how \gls{coap} can be 
implemented on a constrained device and how this device can then transmit
data to the cloud.
