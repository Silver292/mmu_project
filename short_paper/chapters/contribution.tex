Most of the above related \gls{iot} architectures are deployed 
using either \gls{mqtt} or \gls{http}.
However, this paper proposes a \gls{coap}--based \gls{iot} architecture, 
which uses \gls{coap} to transmit sensor data from \gls{rpi} 
to ThingsBoard \gls{iot} cloud platform to monitor and 
visualise sensor devices and share it with users.
