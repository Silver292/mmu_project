With the increasing adoption of \gls{iot} systems and technology in day to day
life, it becomes increasingly important for the devices to be able to operate
at peak efficiency. As there are numerous technologies and standards that allow
different \gls{iot} devices to communicate, this paper investigates the use
of \gls{coap} in order to determine:
\begin{enumerate*}
    \item how \gls{coap} transfers data from an \gls{iot} device to another \gls{coap} node.
    \item how a \gls{rpi} can be used as a flexible platform to provide sensor data.
    \item how this data can be sent to a cloud platform.
\end{enumerate*}
