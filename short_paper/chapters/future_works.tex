Further work can be done in connecting the \gls{rpi} to the cloud. The Python
script running on the \gls{rpi} can be improved by having a \gls{coap} endpoint
created which can then send the sensor data to the cloud endpoint. This can be
achieved using the CoAPthon library identified in this paper. The cloud platform
provided by ThingWorks allows for \gls{iot} devices to send data directly to the 
cloud by providing a \gls{coap} \gls{rest} \gls{api} to which data can be sent.
