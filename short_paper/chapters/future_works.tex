Further work can be done with the data once it has been sent to the cloud.
The ThingsBoard platform offers many options with regards to actions performed,
based on data received from the \gls{iot} devices. Setting up alerts when data
falls outside of expected ranges, and sending messages to other \gls{iot} 
devices as a result, would allow this study to be applied to other uses such
as smart home automation. It would also be of interest to connect an 
actuator to the \gls{rpi} and see how this could be manipulated based on
\gls{coap} messages sent from the cloud.
