  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to interconnect a myriad of devices. Emerging networking and backend support technology not only has to anticipate this dramatic increase in connected nodes, but also a change in traffic patterns. Instead of bulk data such as file sharing or multimedia streaming, IoT devices will primarily exchange real-time sensory and control data in small but numerous messages. Often cloud services will handle these data from a huge number of devices, and hence need to be extremely scalable to support conceivable large-scale IoT applications. To this end, we present a system architecture for IoT cloud services based on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which is primarily designed for systems of tiny, low-cost, resource-constrained IoT devices. Along with our system architecture, we systematically evaluate the performance of the new Web protocol in cloud environments. Our Californium (Cf) CoAP framework shows 33 to 64 times higher throughput than high-performance HTTP Web servers, which are the state of the art for classic cloud services. The results substantiate that the low overhead of CoAP does not only enable Web technology for lowcost IoT devices, but also significantly improves backend service scalability for vast numbers of connected devices.},

  abstract = {Unlike traditional networked embedded systems, the Internet of Things interconnects heterogeneous devices from various manufacturers with diverse functionalities. To foster the emergence of novel applications, this vast infrastructure requires a common application layer. As a single global standard for all device types and application domains is impracticable, we propose an architecture where the infrastructure is agnostic of applications and application development is fully decoupled from the embedded domain. In our design, the application logic of devices is running on application servers, while thin servers embedded into devices export only their elementary functionality using REST resources. In this paper, we present our design goals and preliminary results of this approach, featuring the Californium (Cf) CoAP framework.},

Such relevant attention is also demonstrated by the emergence of interesting IoT-cloud platforms from industry and open-source communities, as well as by the flourishing research area of fog/edge computing, where decentralized virtual resources at edge nodes can support enhanced scalability and reduced latency via locality-based optimizations. In this perspective, this paper proposes an innovative distributed architecture combining machine-to-machine industry-mature protocols (i.e., MQTT and CoAP) in an original way to enhance the scalability of gateways for the efficient IoT-cloud integration. In addition, the paper presents how we have applied the approach in the practical experience of efficiently and effectively extending the implementation of the open-source gateway that is available in the industry-oriented Kura framework for IoT.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) aims at connecting billions of devices in an Internet-like structure. This gigantic information exchange enables new opportunities and new forms of interactions among things and people. A crucial enabler of robust applications and easy smart objects’ deployment is the availability of mechanisms that minimize (ideally, cancel) the need for external human intervention for conﬁguration and maintenance of deployed objects. These mechanisms must also be scalable, since the number of deployed objects is expected to constantly grow in the next years. In this work, we propose a scalable and self-conﬁguring peer-to-peer (P2P)-based architecture for largescale IoT networks, aiming at providing automated service and resource discovery mechanisms, which require no human intervention for their conﬁguration. In particular, we focus on both local and global service discovery (SD), showing how the proposed architecture allows the local and global mechanisms to successfully interact, while keeping their mutual independence (from an operational viewpoint). The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is conﬁrmed by experimental results obtained through a real-world deployment.},

This paper surveys on the application layer communication protocols to fulfil the IoT communication requirements, and their potential for implementation in fog- and cloud-based IoT systems. To this end, the paper first presents a comparative analysis of the main characteristics of IoT communication protocols, including request-reply and publish-subscribe protocols. After that, the paper surveys the protocols that are widely adopted and implemented in each segment of the system (IoT, fog, cloud), and thus opens up the discussion on their interoperability and wider system integration. Finally, the paper reviews the main performance issues, including latency, energy consumption and network throughput. The survey is expected to be useful to system architects and protocol designers when choosing the communication protocols in an integrated IoT-to-fog-to-cloud system architecture.},

  abstract = {Typical Internet of Things (IoT) applications involve collecting information automatically from diverse geographically-distributed smart sensors and concentrating the information into more powerful computers. The Raspberry Pi platform has become a very interesting choice for IoT applications for several reasons: (1) good computing power/cost ratio; (2) high availability; it has become a de facto hardware standard; and (3) ease of use; it is based on operating systems with a big community of users. In IoT applications, data are frequently carried by means of wireless sensor networks in which energy consumption is a key issue. Energy consumption is especially relevant for smart sensors that are scattered over wide geographical areas and may need to work unattended on batteries for long intervals of time. In this scenario, it is convenient to ease the construction of IoT applications while keeping energy consumption to a minimum at the sensors. This work proposes a possible gateway implementation with speciﬁc technologies. It solves the following research question: how to build gateways for IoT applications with Raspberry Pi and low power IQRF communication modules. The following contributions are presented: (1) one architecture for IoT gateways that integrates data from sensor nodes into a higher level application based on low-cost/low-energy technologies; (2) bindings in Java and C that ease the construction of IoT applications; (3) an empirical model that describes the consumption of the communications at the nodes (smart sensors) and allows scaling their batteries; and (4) validation of the proposed energy model at the battery-operated nodes.},

  doi = {10.1109/COMSWA.2008.4554519},
  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) pose novel challenges compared with traditional networks. To answer such challenges a new communication paradigm, data-centric communication, is emerging. One form of data-centric communication is the publish/subscribe messaging system. Compared with other data-centric variants, publish/subscribe systems are common and wide-spread in distributed computing. Thus, extending publish/subscribe systems intoWSNs will simplify the integration of sensor applications with other distributed applications. This paper describes MQTT-S [1], an extension of the open publish/subscribe protocol message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) [2] to WSNs. MQTT-S is designed in such a way that it can be run on low-end and battery-operated sensor/actuator devices and operate over bandwidth-constraint WSNs such as ZigBee-based networks. Various protocol design points are discussed and compared. MQTT-S has been implemented and is currently being tested on the IBM wireless sensor networking testbed [3]. Implementation aspects, open challenges and future work are also presented.},

The system is aimed to prevent delays in the arrival of patients' medical information to the healthcare providers, particularly in accident and emergency situations, to stop manual data entering, and to increase beds capacity in hospitals, especially during public events where a large number of people are meeting in one place. The architecture for this system is based on medical sensors which measure patients physical parameters by using wireless sensor networks (WSNs). These sensors transfer data from patients' bodies over the wireless network to the cloud environment. Therefore, patients will have a high quality services because the e-heath smart system supports medical staff by providing real-time data gathering, eliminating manual data collection, enabling the monitoring of huge numbers of patients.},

Up to now, the two main approaches to provide data access to things have been based on either multihop mesh networks using short-range communication technologies in the unlicensed spectrum, or long-range legacy cellular technologies, mainly 2G/GSM/GPRS, operating in the corresponding licensed frequency bands. Recently, these reference models have been challenged by a new type of wireless connectivity, characterized by low-rate, long-range transmission technologies in the unlicensed sub-gigahertz frequency bands, used to realize access networks with star topology referred to as low-power WANs (LPWANs). In this article, we introduce this new approach to provide connectivity in the IoT scenario, discussing its advantages over the established paradigms in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and architectural design, particularly for typical smart city applications.},

This research is part of development of IoT application for supporting mother and child health program in Indonesia. This IoT-based real time monitoring system enables preventive care and promotes automation to reduce the risk of human error. Measurement of heart rate and SpO 2 is done by pulse oximetry method using sensor module and Raspberry Pi. The Arduino-based sensor module collects, calculates and sends heart rate and SpO 2 data to Raspberry Pi for further analysis based on normal value reference table to detect abnormalities. Further heart rate, SpO 2 and its abnormality status are delivered to Thingsboard using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol. The results show that the system is functioned as expected. Heart rate value (in beat per minute) and SpO 2 value (in percent) are presented while Photoplethysmogram signal (PPG) is presented as graphic on Thingsboard dashboard. The abnormalities status such as tachycardia, bradycardia and hypoxsemia are also featured on the dashboard. We also calculate uncertainty measurement of heart rate and SpO 2 by the sensor module which are ±2.85 bpm and ±0.28\%.},
