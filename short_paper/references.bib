	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to interconnect a myriad of devices. Emerging networking and backend support technology not only has to anticipate this dramatic increase in connected nodes, but also a change in traffic patterns. Instead of bulk data such as file sharing or multimedia streaming, IoT devices will primarily exchange real-time sensory and control data in small but numerous messages. Often cloud services will handle these data from a huge number of devices, and hence need to be extremely scalable to support conceivable large-scale IoT applications. To this end, we present a system architecture for IoT cloud services based on the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP), which is primarily designed for systems of tiny, low-cost, resource-constrained IoT devices. Along with our system architecture, we systematically evaluate the performance of the new Web protocol in cloud environments. Our Californium (Cf) CoAP framework shows 33 to 64 times higher throughput than high-performance HTTP Web servers, which are the state of the art for classic cloud services. The results substantiate that the low overhead of CoAP does not only enable Web technology for lowcost IoT devices, but also significantly improves backend service scalability for vast numbers of connected devices.},

To foster the emergence of novel applications, this vast infrastructure requires a common application layer. As a single global standard for all device types and application domains is impracticable, we propose an architecture where the infrastructure is agnostic of applications and application development is fully decoupled from the embedded domain. In our design, the application logic of devices is running on application servers, while thin servers embedded into devices export only their elementary functionality using REST resources. In this paper, we present our design goals and preliminary results of this approach, featuring the Californium (Cf) CoAP framework.},

Such relevant attention is also demonstrated by the emergence of interesting IoT-cloud platforms from industry and open-source communities, as well as by the flourishing research area of fog/edge computing, where decentralized virtual resources at edge nodes can support enhanced scalability and reduced latency via locality-based optimizations. In this perspective, this paper proposes an innovative distributed architecture combining machine-to-machine industry-mature protocols (i.e., MQTT and CoAP) in an original way to enhance the scalability of gateways for the efficient IoT-cloud integration. In addition, the paper presents how we have applied the approach in the practical experience of efficiently and effectively extending the implementation of the open-source gateway that is available in the industry-oriented Kura framework for IoT.},

This gigantic information exchange enables new opportunities and new forms of interactions among things and people. A crucial enabler of robust applications and easy smart objects’ deployment is the availability of mechanisms that minimize (ideally, cancel) the need for external human intervention for conﬁguration and maintenance of deployed objects. These mechanisms must also be scalable, since the number of deployed objects is expected to constantly grow in the next years. In this work, we propose a scalable and self-conﬁguring peer-to-peer (P2P)-based architecture for largescale IoT networks, aiming at providing automated service and resource discovery mechanisms, which require no human intervention for their conﬁguration. In particular, we focus on both local and global service discovery (SD), showing how the proposed architecture allows the local and global mechanisms to successfully interact, while keeping their mutual independence (from an operational viewpoint). The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is conﬁrmed by experimental results obtained through a real-world deployment.},

Android smartphones and tablets offer several power hungry hardware components and the app developers are exploiting these components at disposal to provide revolutionary user experience. But the battery life has not increased at the same pace to support the power demand. Thus many researches have been carried out to investigate how to minimize the power consumption in smartphones. This paper reports four different research themes towards the reduction of smartphone power consumption. Efforts have been made to survey Android power saving apps available in Google play Apps store as the basis to find out different power saving approaches, operations and limitations. Then we present four different avenues to prolong the batter life of Android devices. The first two approaches include usage pattern analysis to generate power saving profiles. The advantage being that the power saving profiles are customized to actual user behavior. Integrating a photovoltaic film on top of the smartphone and tablet touch screen to generate electricity is also mentioned. The usage pattern based power saving profile generation has several privacy concerns which are discussed and countermeasures are proposed. Some emerging security attacks are also briefed.},

The architectural design, prototypes implementation, flow of network operations and a real-life test scenario are illustrated. The prototype Android application registers higher CPU usage and power consumption due to intense network operations and parsing sensor metadata repeatedly.

This paper surveys on the application layer communication protocols to fulfil the IoT communication requirements, and their potential for implementation in fog- and cloud-based IoT systems. To this end, the paper first presents a comparative analysis of the main characteristics of IoT communication protocols, including request-reply and publish-subscribe protocols. After that, the paper surveys the protocols that are widely adopted and implemented in each segment of the system (IoT, fog, cloud), and thus opens up the discussion on their interoperability and wider system integration. Finally, the paper reviews the main performance issues, including latency, energy consumption and network throughput. The survey is expected to be useful to system architects and protocol designers when choosing the communication protocols in an integrated IoT-to-fog-to-cloud system architecture.},

The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.},

There are five services in this paper: opening the door via facial recognition with a servo motor, detecting motion and sending alarms to their family members, getting real-time indoor temperatures, remotely toggling the light switch on or off, and measuring the amount of trash in a selected trash bin. All functions are controlled by an Android application that can be customized depending on the specific visual needs of the user. This project proposes solutions to help the elderly benefit from user-friendly IoT technology.

	abstract = {Typical Internet of Things (IoT) applications involve collecting information automatically from diverse geographically-distributed smart sensors and concentrating the information into more powerful computers. The Raspberry Pi platform has become a very interesting choice for IoT applications for several reasons: (1) good computing power/cost ratio; (2) high availability; it has become a de facto hardware standard; and (3) ease of use; it is based on operating systems with a big community of users. In IoT applications, data are frequently carried by means of wireless sensor networks in which energy consumption is a key issue. Energy consumption is especially relevant for smart sensors that are scattered over wide geographical areas and may need to work unattended on batteries for long intervals of time. In this scenario, it is convenient to ease the construction of IoT applications while keeping energy consumption to a minimum at the sensors. This work proposes a possible gateway implementation with speciﬁc technologies. It solves the following research question: how to build gateways for IoT applications with Raspberry Pi and low power IQRF communication modules. The following contributions are presented: (1) one architecture for IoT gateways that integrates data from sensor nodes into a higher level application based on low-cost/low-energy technologies; (2) bindings in Java and C that ease the construction of IoT applications; (3) an empirical model that describes the consumption of the communications at the nodes (smart sensors) and allows scaling their batteries; and (4) validation of the proposed energy model at the battery-operated nodes.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) pose novel challenges compared with traditional networks. To answer such challenges a new communication paradigm, data-centric communication, is emerging. One form of data-centric communication is the publish/subscribe messaging system. Compared with other data-centric variants, publish/subscribe systems are common and wide-spread in distributed computing. Thus, extending publish/subscribe systems intoWSNs will simplify the integration of sensor applications with other distributed applications. This paper describes MQTT-S [1], an extension of the open publish/subscribe protocol message queuing telemetry transport (MQTT) [2] to WSNs. MQTT-S is designed in such a way that it can be run on low-end and battery-operated sensor/actuator devices and operate over bandwidth-constraint WSNs such as ZigBee-based networks. Various protocol design points are discussed and compared. MQTT-S has been implemented and is currently being tested on the IBM wireless sensor networking testbed [3]. Implementation aspects, open challenges and future work are also presented.},
