\subsection{Hardware}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Raspberry Pi 3

        Raspberry Pi 3 Model B, includes built in WiFi, \gls{gpio} ports and a 1.2GHz Quad-Core processor.
    \item Micro SD card
    
        Used to load operating system onto the \gls{rpi}.
    \item Power cord
    
        Supplies power to the \gls{rpi}.
    \item DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor
    
        Connects to the \gls{rpi} using the \gls{rpi}'s \gls{gpio} ports. Will be used to provide data.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Software}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Python 3

        The Python programming language will be used to create the scripts and software needed on the \gls{rpi}.
        This is due to the languages popularity when creating projects on the \gls{rpi} and the languages wide selection
        of networking packages.
    \item CoAPthon
    
        Python implementation of \gls{coap}. Licensed under the MIT license. \href{https://github.com/Tanganelli/CoAPthon}{Github}.

    \item AdaFruit Python DHT
        
        Python library to retrieve sensor data from the DHT22. \href{https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_DHT}{Github}.

    \item Git Version Control
    
        Source code version control system to allow for adjustments to the code.

    \item Cloud Platform
    
        Will act as an end point to the \gls{rpi} where the sensor data will be stored.
