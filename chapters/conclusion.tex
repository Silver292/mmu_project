This research investigates the use of \gls{coap} in transmitting sensor data
to the cloud. It aims to explore how \gls{coap} fits into the \gls{iot} ecosystem and
what advantages, if any, it offers to other protocols. It also shows how a \gls{rpi} can
be used with Python to create an \gls{iot} device and connect to the cloud.
